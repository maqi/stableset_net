/// Represents a CashNote (CashNote).
///
/// A CashNote is like a check. Only the recipient can spend it.
///
/// A CashNote has a MainPubkey representing the recipient of the CashNote.
///
/// An MainPubkey consists of a PublicKey.
/// The user who receives payments to this MainPubkey, will be holding
/// a MainSecretKey - a secret key, which corresponds to the MainPubkey.
///
/// The MainPubkey can be given out to multiple parties and
/// multiple CashNotes can share the same MainPubkey.
///
/// The spentbook nodes never sees the MainPubkey. Instead, when a
/// transaction output cashnote is created for a given MainPubkey, a random
/// derivation index is generated and used to derive a UniquePubkey, which will be
/// used for this new cashnote.
///
/// The UniquePubkey is a unique identifier of a CashNote.
/// So there can only ever be one CashNote with that id, previously, now and forever.
/// The UniquePubkey consists of a PublicKey. To unlock the tokens of the CashNote,
/// the corresponding DerivedSecretKey (consists of a SecretKey) must be used.
/// It is derived from the MainSecretKey, in the same way as the UniquePubkey was derived
/// from the MainPubkey to get the UniquePubkey.
///
/// So, there are two important pairs to conceptually be aware of.
/// The MainSecretKey and MainPubkey is a unique pair of a user, where the MainSecretKey
/// is held secret, and the MainPubkey is given to all and anyone who wishes to send tokens to you.
/// A sender of tokens will derive the UniquePubkey from the MainPubkey, which will identify the CashNote that
/// holds the tokens going to the recipient. The sender does this using a derivation index.
/// The recipient of the tokens, will use the same derivation index, to derive the DerivedSecretKey
/// from the MainSecretKey. The DerivedSecretKey and UniquePubkey pair is the second important pair.
/// For an outsider, there is no way to associate either the DerivedSecretKey or the UniquePubkey to the MainPubkey
/// (or for that matter to the MainSecretKey, if they were ever to see it, which they shouldn't of course).
/// Only by having the derivation index, which is only known to sender and recipient, can such a connection be made.
///
/// To spend or work with a CashNote, wallet software must obtain the corresponding
/// MainSecretKey from the user, and then call an API function that accepts a MainSecretKey,
/// eg: `cashnote.derivation_index(&main_key)`
